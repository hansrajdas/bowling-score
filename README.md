## Requirement
It should provide the following:
* A way to start a new bowling game;
* A way to input the number of pins knocked down by each ball;
* A way to output the current game score (score for each frame and total score).

This API can be used by a bowling house. On the screen the user starts the game, then after each throw the machine, with a sensor, counts how many pins were dropped and calls the API sending this information. In the meantime the screen is constantly (for example: every 2 seconds) asking the API for the current game status and displays it.
Scoring rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling

## Prerequisites

## Assumptions
* This application supports one game and one player a time
* When a new game is started previous game's score will be lost
